# Questions for EICR (Electrical Installation Condition Report) Inspections Service Pages

These questions will help create comprehensive service pages for electrical inspections that target different towns and address searcher intent for various customer types (homeowners, landlords, solicitors/buyers, etc.).

**Note:** EICR = Electrical Installation Condition Report (not EICH/EIC)

## Service Details & Pricing

1. **Pricing Structure**
   - **ANSWER:** £150 is the fixed price for all domestic EICH/EIC inspections regardless of property size.
   - **ANSWER:** Commercial inspection pricing depends on the size of the building and number of outlets - all commercial work is priced on request.
   - **ANSWER:** No package deals or discounts mentioned - commercial pricing is individual quotes only.

2. **What's Included**
   - **ANSWER:** £150 domestic inspection covers full inspection of electrical installations, testing of circuits and safety devices, checking earthing and bonding, spotting potential hazards or worn components, and clear documentation of findings.
   - **ANSWER:** A typical inspection takes a few hours but really it's a day's job.
   - **ANSWER:** Customers receive certificates, reports, and recommendations. All documentation is provided the same day.
   - **ANSWER:** Inspection and certificates happen on the same day - no waiting period. These requests can be fitted in more quickly than bigger jobs.

## Legal Requirements & Compliance

3. **Landlord Requirements**
   - **ANSWER:** Landlords are required to have electrical installations inspected and tested every 5 years by a qualified and competent person. Must provide EICR copy to existing tenants within 28 days and to new tenants before occupancy.
   - **ANSWER:** Penalties for non-compliance include financial penalties up to £30,000 imposed by local authorities, remedial notices, and authorities can arrange and recover costs of remedial work if landlord fails to act.
   - **ANSWER:** Requirements apply to most private rental properties including Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). Exceptions include social housing, long-term leases, and certain specialized accommodations. Commercial lets likely have different requirements.

4. **Property Transactions**
   - **ANSWER:** Solicitors recommend buyers get these inspections to identify potential electrical issues before purchase completion.
   - **ANSWER:** Buyers should get inspections before any money changes hands.
   - **ANSWER:** If serious issues are found (like an ancient fuse board), buyers will probably want it fixed and that cost could be discounted from the purchase price. Major issues might even cause buyers to skip the sale entirely.

## Technical & Safety Aspects

5. **What Gets Inspected**
   - **ANSWER:** EICR includes visual inspection (damaged wiring, overheating signs, equipment suitability) and electrical testing (continuity, insulation resistance, earth fault loop impedance, RCD testing). Full inspection of electrical installations, testing of circuits and safety devices, checking earthing and bonding, spotting potential hazards or worn components.
   - **ANSWER:** Most common issues are outdated fuse boards and unsafe wiring. Common unsafe signs include: plug sockets in skirting boards (pre-1960s), bedroom lights near windows (pre-1960s), very few electrical outlets (pre-1980s), old fuse boxes without trip switches (pre-1980s), crème-colored switches and sockets (pre-1970s), flickering lights, burning smells.
   - **ANSWER:** Victorian terraces have more complex inspection requirements due to historical wiring systems (cloth-covered wiring, knob and tube systems, rubber-insulated cables) that pose higher fire risks (70% of electrical fires happen in pre-1950 buildings). They may need more frequent inspections, lack proper earthing, and have load capacity limitations. New builds benefit from modern PVC-insulated wiring, proper earthing, and 5-year exemption periods if they have current EIC certificates.

6. **Safety & Standards**
   - **ANSWER:** EICR tests against current electrical regulations and standards using codes: C1 (immediate danger, requires immediate action), C2 (potentially dangerous, urgent action needed), C3 (improvements recommended), FI (further investigation required).
   - **ANSWER:** You explain technical findings in plain English to non-technical customers.
   - **ANSWER:** Immediate safety concerns requiring emergency recommendations include C1 issues (immediate danger) such as exposed live wiring, damaged equipment creating shock risks, or situations posing fire hazards.

## Location-Specific Considerations

7. **Property Types by Area**
   - **ANSWER:** Victorian terraces (common in Prestwich/Whitefield) typically have issues with outdated wiring systems, inadequate earthing, old fuse boards without RCD protection, and wiring that wasn't designed for modern electrical loads.
   - **ANSWER:** Yes, newer developments (like those in Altrincham/Trafford) have different issues despite being modern: poor installation workmanship (Electrical Safety First found faults in 1 in 5 new builds), loose connections at outlets, inadequate cable support, missing earth bonding, incorrect RCD arrangements, and compliance issues due to rushed construction or subcontractor quality variations.
   - Are there any local authority variations in requirements across the towns you serve?

## Customer Journey & Process

8. **Booking & Scheduling**
   - **ANSWER:** You can get customers scheduled into the diary as soon as they call.
   - **ANSWER:** You don't work evenings or weekends.
   - **ANSWER:** No customer preparation is needed, although if the fuse box is in an awkward space, clearing access would be helpful.

9. **Follow-up Services**
   - **ANSWER:** If you spot issues that need sorting, you explain exactly what needs doing and why, and give fair prices to put it right.
   - **ANSWER:** You can handle any electrical issues discovered during inspection.
   - How do you prioritize which issues need immediate attention vs can wait?

Based on searcher intent and common customer questions:

## General EICR Questions

**Q: What is an EICR and do I need one?**
**A:** An EICR (Electrical Installation Condition Report) is a comprehensive safety assessment of your property's electrical systems. Landlords legally need one every 5 years for rental properties, and homeowners should get one every 10 years or when buying/selling property.

**Q: How much does an EICR cost?**
**A:** £150 for all domestic properties regardless of size. Commercial properties are priced individually based on building size and number of outlets - contact us for a quote.

**Q: How long does an EICR take?**
**A:** A typical inspection takes a few hours but it's really a day's job. You get all certificates and reports the same day - no waiting period.

**Q: Can I book an EICR quickly?**
**A:** Yes, we can get you scheduled as soon as you call. EICR inspections can be fitted in more quickly than bigger electrical jobs.

## For Landlords

**Q: How often do landlords need EICRs?**
**A:** Every 5 years, plus for each new tenant. You must provide the report to existing tenants within 28 days and to new tenants before they move in.

**Q: What happens if I don't get an EICR as a landlord?**
**A:** Local authorities can impose fines up to £30,000, serve remedial notices, and arrange costly remedial work if you fail to comply.

**Q: Do HMOs need different EICR requirements?**
**A:** No, HMOs follow the same 5-yearly EICR requirements as standard rental properties.

## For Property Buyers

**Q: Should I get an EICR when buying a house?**
**A:** Yes, get an EICR before any money changes hands. If serious issues are found (like ancient fuse boards), repair costs can be negotiated off the purchase price or may cause you to avoid the purchase entirely.

**Q: Do new build homes need EICRs?**
**A:** New builds with current EIC certificates are exempt for 5 years. However, research shows 1 in 5 new builds have electrical faults, so an EICR can provide peace of mind.
