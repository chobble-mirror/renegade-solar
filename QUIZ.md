We are going to add more pages to this website to promote more services.

I'm going to write some notes below, and you will combine those with the existing content in src/pages, src/services and src/accreditations to come up with a list of questions needed to create really good service pages which address searcher intent. I'll ask Renegade these questions and we'll use the answers as a basis for new "<service> in <town>" pages.

We're going to make town pages for Prestwich, Whitefield, Bury, Radcliffe, Altrincham, Trafford, Stockport.

The services are:

## EICH and EIC Inspections

- Â£150 for a domestic inspection
- Commercial price depends on size
- Landlords need these
- Solicitors ask buyers to get them
- They're pretty easy to carry out

## Fuse Board Upgrades

- These include EICH and EIC
- Old boards have no 12cd (??) protection
- New boards fit current regulations
- Takes about 4 hours

## Ring Security Lights / Cameras

- Getting loads of requests for these nowadays

Bear in mind that Renegade is targeting all types of homes and commercial businesses in North Manchester, like victorian terraces as well as new builds or factories. These pages will target people of different levels of wealth. We want to attract savvy searchers who are looking for specific accreditations and willing to pay realistic prices.

Given all of the above, write three docs - one for each topic - in the root of this repo. Each doc will ask questions to Renegade whose answers we can use to create useful pages that address searcher intent.
