  "Initial interactions were good and on first meeting for site survey, Ashley was friendly and polite. It soon became obvious of his limitations in energy storage setups. Despite his limitations he was very keen to take on the project and because of this I decided to offer him the job and agreed do the leg work by getting him all relevant information to make things easier. Having done the legwork Ashley then pulled out without any explanations beside that itâ€™s best to look for somebody else to do the job and then blocked me from making any further contact. Very unprofessional and discourteous",

After inspecting, he let us know that it was fully unnecessary and that we just needed a new fuse board. He saved us thousands of pounds with that first visit and he immediately became our go-to electrician. Since then Ashley has fitted solar panels and a battery, a doorbell, new light sockets, outdoor lighting & power, a bathroom extractor fan, removed old ariels, and probably more stuff I can't remember. I can't fault him at all and have recommended him to my friends.",
