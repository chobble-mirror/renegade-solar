## What is the HEIS Consumer Code?

All prospective members must undergo a rigorous accreditation process before they can join a trusted network of installers. Once approved, they are subject to annual vetting to ensure they continue adhering to our scheme rules and code of practice.

In addition to the following free benefits:

- Deposit protection
- Stage payment protection
- Insurance-backed guarantees

Consumers using HEIS accredited members can access a robust alternative dispute resolution service, which is approved by the [Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI)](https://www.tradingstandards.uk). This ensures consumers are protected at every step of their journey.
