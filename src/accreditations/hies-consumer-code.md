# HIES Consumer Code

How does HIES protect consumers?
All prospective members must endure a rigorous accreditation process before they can join our trusted network of installers. Once approved, they will be subject to annual vetting to ensure they are adhering to our scheme rules and code of practice.

In addition to free deposit protection, free stage payment protection and free insurance backed guarantees, consumers using one of our accredited members can benefit from our robust, Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) approved alternative dispute resolution service, thus ensuring they are protected at every step of their customer journey
