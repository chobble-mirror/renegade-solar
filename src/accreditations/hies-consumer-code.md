# Why Choose a HEIS Consumer Code Member for Your Solar Installation

When you're looking for a solar panel installer it's important to choose someone who is a member of the **Home Energy Installation Systems (HEIS) Consumer Code**. This code provides protection and peace of mind throughout your solar panel installation process.

## What is the HEIS Consumer Code?

The HEIS Consumer Code is a set of standards that approved solar installers must follow. As a member, I am committed to:

- Providing clear information before, during and after your installation
- Using fair contracts with transparent terms
- Delivering professional workmanship
- Offering proper after-sales service
- Following proper complaints procedures if anything goes wrong

## Why This Matters for Your Solar Installation

Many homeowners in Manchester are now considering solar panels to reduce energy bills and their environmental impact. When investing in solar technology, working with a trusted professional ensures:

1. Your system is installed correctly and safely
2. The installation complies with all electrical regulations
3. You receive proper documentation for warranty purposes
4. Your system performs as promised

## Local Experience Matters

As a North Manchester-based electrician with over 15 years of experience, I understand the specific requirements for solar installations in Prestwich, Whitefield, Middleton, and all nearby towns. My background in both domestic and commercial electrical work provides the knowledge needed to handle solar panel systems of all sizes.
