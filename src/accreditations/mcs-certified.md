# MCS Certified Solar Installer

The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) is the gold standard for renewable energy installations in the UK, providing comprehensive certification for both products and installers.

## Why MCS Certification Is Crucial For Your Solar Project

### Access to Financial Incentives

MCS certification is mandatory for homeowners wishing to access government schemes like the [Smart Export Guarantee (ofgem.gov.uk)](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg), allowing you to get paid for excess energy you generate.

### Internationally Recognised Standards

My MCS certification ensures all installations meet rigorous technical standards that are aligned with international quality benchmarks.

### Quality-Assured Equipment

I only install MCS-certified solar products that have been independently tested for performance, durability and safety â€“ protecting your investment for years to come.

### Technical Expertise

My MCS status confirms I've demonstrated the technical knowledge and practical skills needed to design and install efficient, effective solar systems throughout North Manchester.

### Consumer Protection

MCS certification includes membership in a consumer code (like HIES), providing additional safeguards for your project from quote to completion.

## Verified Credentials

You can easily check my MCS certification on the [official MCS website](https://mcscertified.com/find-an-installer/) using my certification number: **NAP-66870**
