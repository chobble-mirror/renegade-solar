# Solar Panel Installer in Altrincham

MCS-certified solar panel and battery installations throughout Altrincham. Our North Manchester-based company installs systems on all property types with personal oversight by Ashley Merritt. All installations qualify for Smart Export Guarantee payments.

## Solar Solutions for Altrincham Properties

We install solar panels on:
- Victorian and Edwardian properties in conservation areas
- Modern detached and semi-detached homes
- Contemporary new-build developments
- Converted apartments in historic buildings
- Commercial properties

We work with slate roofs on period homes and tile roofs on newer properties, maximizing energy generation while complementing architectural aesthetics.

## Solar Performance in Manchester's Climate

Solar panels perform excellently in Manchester despite our reputation for rain:
- Modern panels generate electricity from daylight, not just direct sunshine
- Panels operate more efficiently in cooler Manchester temperatures
- Rain helps keep panels clean for peak efficiency
- Systems generate significant electricity even during winter months

## Local Installer Advantages

- Direct contact with Ashley throughout your entire project
- No pushy salespeople or confusing quotes
- Quick response for site visits and aftercare
- Deep understanding of Altrincham properties and planning considerations
- Premium components with comprehensive warranties
- 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating from 80+ verified reviews

## Battery Solutions

We offer standalone battery systems ideal for:
- Properties in conservation areas with planning restrictions
- Apartments with limited roof access
- Homes affected by shading
- Properties where aesthetics are a primary concern

These battery systems work with time-of-use tariffs, charging during cheaper off-peak periods and powering your home during expensive peak times.

## Areas Covered

We serve all Altrincham areas including Town Centre, Bowdon, Hale, Timperley, Broadheath, West Timperley, Navigation Road, Oldfield Brow, Sale, Hale Barns, and Dunham Massey.
