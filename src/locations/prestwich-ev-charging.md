Based in Prestwich, Renegade Solar provides expert EV charger installations throughout the local area. As a NAPIT-registered installer and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, we handle everything from initial survey to final certification.

## Local EV Charging Expertise

Our Prestwich base means we understand the local housing stock and electrical systems. Whether you live in a Victorian terrace or modern development, we can recommend the most suitable EV charging solution for your property.

## Smart Integration Options

We specialise in integrating EV chargers with existing solar panels and home battery systems. This allows you to charge your vehicle using excess solar energy, dramatically reducing your charging costs during sunny periods.

## What Our Customers Say

> "Ashley fitted an EV charger for me and provided lots of brilliant advice prior to doing so, as I was clueless on the whole thing. His advice even allowed me to keep costs down and his prices were the best quotes I had, with nothing reduced on the quality of his work."

> "Ashley was friendly, knowledgeable and did a great job. He ensured that our new GivEnergy charger was properly integrated with the solar and battery system. During the job he found an earthing fault from previous work - and fixed this small job at no extra cost."
