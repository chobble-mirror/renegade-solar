## We are Renegade Solar

My name is Ashley, and I'm from North Manchester. I have over 15 years experience working as an electrician, with 10 years experience working on commercial projects.

In 2016 I went to the Channel Islands and worked on high end mansions and apartments, supplying power and lighting to loft conversions, kitchens, extensions and all other types of domestic & commercial services, even industrial properties like the Jersey Recycling Centre.

I moved back to Manchester and in 2018 I decided to go out on my own and started Renegade Electrical.

Like most people in todays world, I am genuinely concerned about the effects of climate change that affect every human being on the planet. As I have 2 small children I want to help build a better future for our children before it's too late.

During the energy crisis in 2022, I observed the price rises along with 40 degree temperatures and decided to complete all the necessary qualifications to start Renegade Solar.

I am amazed at how much power these new modern panels can generate on a rooftop in the North of England, and you will be amazed at how much money you will save!
