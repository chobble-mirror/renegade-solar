## We are Renegade Solar

My name is Ashley Merritt and i am the owner of Renegade Solar, I'm from North Manchester. I have over 15 years experience working as an electrician, with 10 years experience working on commercial projects.

In 2016 I went to the Channel Islands and worked on high end mansions and apartments, supplying power and lighting to loft conversions, kitchens, extensions and all other types of domestic & commercial services, even industrial properties like the Jersey Recycling Centre.

I moved back to Manchester and in 2018 I decided to go out on my own and started Renegade Electrical.

Like most people in todays world, I am genuinely concerned about the effects of climate change, but at the same time i  understand the need for renewable solutions that suit eveybodys needs , that may be  a commercial business trying to cut down energy costs or a family trying to save money just the same, either way at renegade so,lar we have a solution for you.  


I am amazed at how much power these new modern panels can generate on a rooftop in the North of England, and together with batterry storage you will be amazed at how much money you will save!
