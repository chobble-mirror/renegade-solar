# Home Battery Installation

With our home battery-only installations, you can benefit from cheap energy by charging your home battery during off-peak times and using that stored energy when prices are higher.

Off-peak prices can be as little as **one third** the price of peak! [Check out Octopus Energy's tariffs page for details.](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/)

Charging your battery will save you money all year round, even during the middle of winter when panels are less effective!
