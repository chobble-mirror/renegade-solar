## Design and Planning

From start to finish, you will have a personal design specialist going through the different types of installation: on roof, in roof, ground mounted or flat roof. While tailoring a design and quote to suit you, your home or property and your energy needs, every project is different but large or small will all get the same attention to detail.

## Installation

All installations are carried out courteously and professionally with the minimum possible disruption to you, your family or your business.

## Commissioning

Governed by the country's leading standards, your installation will be tested and commissioned with the very highest regard to safety and legislation.

## Aftercare

Always available to provide further assistance with your new installation with 2 years routine maintenance included in all our installations.

All equipment comes with at least a 5 year warranty and some panels come with warranty of up to 30 years!
